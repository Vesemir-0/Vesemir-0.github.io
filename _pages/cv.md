The 15,000-word report developed through interview data analysis revealed development challenges in cash crop-dependent regions. Research activities included framework design, fieldwork coordination, and policy analysis, contributing to the 19th "Challenge Cup" competition.

### **Adjustment Strategies of Grassroots Responsive Governance in Constrained Contexts: A Case Study of 12345 Mayor Hotline in Subdistrict A, City C** 
*April 2024 - June 2024*

- This case study analysed three representative cases from Chengdu's mayoral hotline system, employing qualitative methods to examine adaptive governance strategies under institutional constraints. The research developed a theoretical framework of response mechanisms, resulting in a 9,800-word paper. The project enhanced competencies in policy process analysis and empirical theorisation, earning First Prize at Jilin University's 6th "Beichen" Undergraduate Forum on Political Science and Public Administration.

### **The Impact Mechanism of Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) on College Students' Mental Health and Intervention Strategies: A Case Study of Sichuan University** 
*April 2024 - May 2024*

The 3,800-word research report demonstrated proficiency in regression analysis of direct/mediation effects, earning Third Prize in Sichuan University's 6th Psychological Survey Competition.

### **From "Learning in Practice" to "Learning from Practice": A Study on the Construction Mechanism of Comprehensive Service Stations for Migrant Workers from the Perspective of Social Learning Theory -- An Investigation Based on Chengdu** 
*January 2024 - April 2024*

- This study examined the development mechanisms of migrant worker service centres across multiple Chengdu communities through field research and theoretical analysis grounded in social learning theory. The 21,000-word research report involved framework design and institutional analysis, contributing to the 17th Zhejiang University Model Mayor Forum. The project enhanced understanding of migrant worker social security policies and community-based research methodologies.

### **Exploring the Daily Lives of Homeless Populations through Baidu 'Wanderers Bar': A Textual Analysis Based on LDA Topic Modelling**
*November 2023 - April 2024*

- This study collected and analysed over 80,000 text entries (2014-2024 dataset) from Baidu's online forum using web scraping, LDA topic modelling, and sentiment analysis techniques. The 2,000-word preliminary paper examined homeless populations' living conditions and coping strategies across mainland China, Taiwan, and New York through computational text analysis and literature review, contributing to Tsinghua University's 3rd Undergraduate Social Science Forum.

### **Multiple Consensus and Identity Formation: How Community Social Enterprises Empower Community Governance - A Case Study of Chengdu's Hongmen Street Community** 
*January 2024 - March 2024*

- This case study investigated the operational mechanisms of community social enterprises through field research and institutional complexity theory analysis. The 2,000-word research plan developed an analytical framework examining enterprise-governance interactions, contributing to the 8th National "Qiushi Cup" Public Administration Case Competition. The project enhanced understanding of social enterprise challenges in urban governance while developing practical community research skills.

### **Measurement and Analysis of Social Capital in Public Rental Housing Communities: A Study Based on a Chongqing Public Housing Project** 
*(Sichuan University Summer Research Programme)* *June 2023 - October 2023*

- This quantitative study conducted 600+ household surveys to measure social capital in a public rental community, employing factor analysis and mediation regression methods. The 5,600-word research paper demonstrated proficiency in full-cycle empirical research, including scale development, questionnaire design, and advanced statistical analysis, while enhancing understanding of affordable housing policy implementation.

## **COURSE PAPERS**

### **Strong Ties, Broad Reach: How Social Network Structure Influences Official Promotion**

- This empirical study analyzes how social network structures, derived from co-work experiences, affect official promotion speed in China. Using data on 582 provincial-level officials from the China Political Elite Database (CPED), we found through network analysis and linear regression that officials with a "broader reach" (lower eccentricity) and "tighter ties" (more triangles in their network) experience faster promotion. This research demonstrates the heterogeneous impact of both extensive and dense informal networks on career advancement within the Chinese bureaucratic system, considering age and education.

### **Immersion and Disengagement: Exploring a Paradoxical State in Ethnographic Research**

- This theoretical analysis examines the fundamental tension in ethnographic methodology between deep cultural immersion and maintaining an objective "outsider" perspective. Through a critical literature review, the paper identifies how researchers' prolonged immersion risks cultural identity crises and methodological bias, creating a paradoxical situation where the very process of cultural understanding may compromise research objectivity - a core methodological concern in ethnographic practice.

### **Analysis of Regional Disparities in Educational Modernisation Development Levels Within Chengdu**

- This study examines how the centre-local governance dynamic shapes educational inequality across Chengdu. Combining modernisation reports with spatial analytics, we reveal: (1) core urban districts with stable bureaucratic rotations show superior outcomes, (2) development zones with frequent leadership changes lag behind, and (3) these disparities are mediated through occupational restructuring and migrant settlement patterns. The findings elucidate how China's decentralised governance system produces unequal educational modernisation.

### **The Paradigm Shifts in Public Administration: Tradition, Critique, and Critique of Critique**

- This theoretical study examines the historical evolution of public administration through literature analysis, identifying four major paradigm shifts since Wilson's 1887 foundational work: traditional public administration, initial critiques, New Public Management reforms, and the New Public Administration counter-critique, demonstrating how theoretical focus has shifted in response to changing societal demands and intellectual trends.

### **Current Development and Future Prospects of Employment Assistance in China**

- This paper examines China's evolving employment assistance system through literature review, tracing its development from guidance-based concepts to formal legal frameworks featuring vocational training, financial incentives, and public service placements. While identifying persistent implementation challenges, the study synthesises scholarly proposals for improving this crucial social protection mechanism in contemporary China.

### **Analysis of Fiscal Expenditure Structure and Trends in Changshou District, Chongqing (2015-2022)**

- This empirical study analysed budgetary reports to examine expenditure patterns, revealing sustained prioritisation of social welfare (education, healthcare) alongside emerging "retreat from the secondary sector, advance in primary/tertiary sectors" trends. The research identified significant budget volatility from campaign-style governance initiatives while highlighting structural challenges including high administrative costs and policy-driven expenditure instability.

### **The Dual Relationship Between Consumption-Income Ratio and Social Inequality in Consumer Society**

- Drawing on Arendt and Bauman's theories, this study empirically examines how consumption-income ratios affect inequality through two pathways: directly exacerbating income inequality (measured by the Gini coefficient) through differential impacts on various income types, and indirectly by disproportionately increasing working hours across urban occupations (professional, service, clerical workers), revealing consumption's dual role in shaping contemporary social stratification.

### **The Impact of Perceived Social Support on Depression Among Elderly: The Chain Mediating Role of Death Anxiety and Self-Efficacy**

- This survey-based study identified a significant chain mediation pathway where social support reduces elderly depression by sequentially enhancing self-efficacy and alleviating death anxiety, providing empirical evidence for targeted psychological interventions to improve mental health in aging populations.
